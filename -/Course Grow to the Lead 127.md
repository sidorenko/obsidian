Grow to Lead UA #127

Practice 1 – Manager Identity

Case 2:

James became a team lead a year ago. As a leader to the new team, knowing that the team had a strong rapport with the previous leader, James had a tough time getting on well with the team and forming trust. While he was sure he was making all efforts, the team was dissatisfied with him because of his bossy attitude and limited understanding of their work. When the feedback time came, he received negative feedback. How should James handle the situation? What should he have done differently?
