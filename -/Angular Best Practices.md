**Use Angular CLI**
**Modular Architecture**
**Follow Single Responsibility Principle**
**Meaningful Naming Conventions**
**Component Structure**
**Dependency Injection**
**Avoid Direct DOM Manipulations**
**Use Reactive Forms**
**Handle Errors Gracefully**
Implement error handling mechanisms throughout your application. Use Angular’s ErrorHandler to catch and log errors consistently.
**Avoid Directives for Presentational Logic**
Directives are best suited for custom behavior, not presentational logic. Keep presentation-related code in your components.
**Use TrackBy with NgFor**
Using `trackBy` improves performance by helping Angular track items efficiently during change detection.
**Minimize Use of** `**any**` **Type**
**Lazy Loading Modules**
**Leverage Angular’s HttpClient**
```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
```
**Optimize Angular Performance with ChangeDetection strategy** 
```typescript
@Component({  
selector: 'app-list',  
templateUrl: './list.component.html',  
changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush  
})  
export class ListComponent {  
// ...  
}
```
 **Use Ahead-of-Time Compilation**
 Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation is a technique that can improve the performance and security of your Angular application. AOT compilation compiles your Angular templates and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build process, which can improve the startup time of your application and reduce the risk of template injection attacks. Here’s an example of how to enable AOT compilation in Angular:
```typescript
ng build --prod --aot
```
**Use Smart and Dumb Components**
**Use Angular Material for UI components**
Using Angular Material in your application not only saves time and effort in designing and building UI components from scratch but also ensures that your application has a modern and consistent look and feel. Additionally, Angular Material i<font color="#f79646">s responsive and accessible by default,</font> which means your application will work seamlessly on different devices and assistive technologies.
**Write unit tests**
